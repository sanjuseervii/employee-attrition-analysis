INSIGHTS:
📊 Key Insights from Employee Attrition Analysis

The dataset consists of 4,563 employees, out of which 1,600 employees left the organization, indicating a high overall attrition rate.

Out of the total employees who left:

884 were female

716 were male

Female employees show a higher attrition trend, with approximately 55% of female employees leaving, suggesting potential concerns related to workplace safety, flexibility, or work-life balance.

Location-based analysis reveals critical issues:

Around 90% of employees from Pune left the organization, indicating severe dissatisfaction or unfavorable working conditions at this location.

Approximately 50% of employees from New Delhi also left, which is comparatively lower but still significant.

Education level plays a major role in attrition:

Nearly 90% of employees holding a Master’s degree left the job, suggesting a possible mismatch between job roles and employee expectations.

About 50% of employees with a Bachelor’s degree left, indicating better retention compared to Master’s degree holders.
Actionable Recommendations 

The company should improve salary structure, job roles, or work flexibility, especially for employees working in Pune, to reduce the extremely high attrition rate.

Enhanced safety measures, flexible working hours, and supportive workplace policies should be implemented to improve retention among female employees.

For highly educated employees (Master’s degree holders), the company should provide:

Better career growth opportunities

Challenging roles

Skill-utilization aligned with their qualifications
